"""Intent-mismatch detection (advisory only).

NEVER on the hot path of a query the agent is waiting on; NEVER load-bearing
(CLAUDE.md sec. 4, sec. 11). We do not claim to *know* the agent's intent -- we
**detect contradiction** between the agent's stated task (free text it gave us)
and what the statement actually does (its operation and measured blast radius).
On a strong contradiction we raise an advisory flag that can escalate a write to
*human confirmation* -- it never hard-blocks on its own.

The deterministic checks below are pure in-memory string/number heuristics
(microseconds, no I/O), so they are safe to compute inline as advisory metadata.
The optional LLM "second opinion" is strictly out-of-band: scheduled as a
fire-and-forget background task that only appends its opinion to the audit log,
never gating or delaying the agent's query. It is off by default.

Honest limit (sec. 11): we check *query-vs-task*, not *task-vs-reality*. If the
stated task is itself wrong, nothing here catches it.
