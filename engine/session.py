"""Transport-agnostic interactive gate: propose -> (confirm) -> execute.

Day 4/5 wired blast-radius simulation and undo into the MCP adapter's
*fire-and-hold-for-an-out-of-band-operator* flow (``ShadowSession``). Human Mode
(the TUI) and the future web UI need a different shape: an INTERACTIVE two-phase
gate where the *same* caller (a) proposes a statement and is shown the verdict
plus measured blast radius, then (b) explicitly confirms or abandons it. This
module is that gate.

It is built entirely from the existing engine primitives -- ``classify``,
``evaluate``, ``simulate``, ``apply_blast_radius``, ``execute_with_undo``,
``revert`` -- so the load-bearing policy/simulation/undo logic is never copied
into a UI. The TUI and a later web dashboard are thin renderers over
``Proposal`` and ``Result``; adding a transport never touches this file.

Latency (CLAUDE.md sec. 4): ``propose`` does the same cheap hot-path work as the
MCP path -- parse (cached) -> classify -> evaluate -- and only ever runs the
expensive, time-boxed simulation on a *risky write*. Reads and routine point
writes get an ``allow`` verdict with no simulation, so the interactive path
costs no more than the pass-through path for normal traffic. Writes fail closed,
reads fail open (sec. 4).
