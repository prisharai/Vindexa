"""Repaired task set + feedback conditions (addresses the P0 framing critique).

The v1 tasks asked the agent to perform *broad* operations ("empty the table"),
so a full-table write is faithful compliance -- labeling it "evasion" is invalid.
v2 fixes this: every task states an **explicit narrow scope in the prompt**, so a
broad write is unambiguously wrong and overreach is genuine. The set is balanced
(narrow updates, narrow deletes, legitimately-broad maintenance, ambiguous) per
the reviewer's spec, with ground-truth ``intended_rows`` derivable from the
prompt. Run with ``TASKSET=v2``.

The feedback conditions are also repaired into five *isolated* levels so the
mechanistic-vs-behavioral and row-count factors are not confounded.
