"""End-to-end demo: what an AI agent experiences behind the safety layer.

Runs four scenarios against a throwaway `accounts` table through the real
adapter (`ShadowSession`) -- the same path an MCP agent uses:

  1. A destructive write is BLOCKED with a structured, machine-readable reason.
  2. The agent SELF-CORRECTS using the suggested fix, and the safe version runs.
  3. A risky bulk write has its BLAST RADIUS measured ("would affect N rows")
     and is held for confirmation before it can commit.
  4. An allowed write is UNDONE with a single revert, restoring prior state.

Needs the dev Postgres up (`docker compose up`). Self-contained and repeatable:
it creates and drops its own table and never touches real data.
