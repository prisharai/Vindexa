"""Day 0 smoke test.

Confirms the dev stack is actually usable: we can reach the Dockerized Postgres
and the seed completed in full (Pagila + the two large generated tables). This
deliberately checks real row counts rather than ``assert True`` -- the Day 0
blocker was a half-seeded volume that *looked* up but was missing the large
tables (see docs/DECISIONS.md, 2026-06-20). This test would have caught that.

If the database isn't running (e.g. CI without Docker, or before
``docker compose up``), the test SKIPS rather than fails, so the suite stays
green wherever there's no DB to talk to.
