"""Day 8 edge cases: malformed / huge / weird inputs must fail safe.

"Fail safe" means two things, both verified here: (1) nothing ever raises onto
the hot path -- classify and decide always return, even for garbage; and (2)
anything we can't understand, or that is genuinely dangerous, is **blocked**
(fail closed), while harmless no-ops (empty/comment-only) are simply allowed.

Pure, in-memory, no DB.
