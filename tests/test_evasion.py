"""Day 8 evasion suite: disguises must not get danger past the policy.

Because classification is done on the real Postgres AST (never the raw text),
comments / casing / whitespace / quoting cannot smuggle anything through. This
is a *matrix*: every dangerous base statement is run through every disguise and
must still be blocked. The named cases at the bottom are permanent regressions
for evasions found during the build (CLAUDE.md §8 Day 8 -- "every previously-found
evasion is a permanent regression test").

Pure, in-memory (no DB), against the shipped policy.
